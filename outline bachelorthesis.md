1. Introduction
2. Foundations: General information about Knowledge Graphs, Evolving Knowledge Graphs, RDF, SPARQL
	1. RDF
	2. SPARQL
	3. KG
	4. Evolving KG
3. Methodology
	1. Description of Metrics 
	2. Description of aim of tool
4. Implementation
	1. Description of tool design / architecture 
		1. how to build web app, what components
		2. Description of 2 ways: local graph or SPARQL endpoint
	2. Description of used libraries/methods 
	3. Description of used Queries/Algorithms to calculate Metrics
		1. Description of problem cases (different endpoints using different triplestores (addressing bnodes) / tool may not work with too large graphs etc.)
	4. Justifying of assumptions made in queries 
5. Usage
	1. Example results with one local graph 
	2. Example with one named graph of an endpoint
